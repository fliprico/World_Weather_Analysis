# Weather_Analysis

# The purpose of our analysis was to use the weather description data  already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. The beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta testers will then choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary.

# With the use of the initial dependencies and Google Maps API we were able to generate a weather database map for using the Google Maps API as referenced below

# Pop Up markers were also generated using Google Maps API to get a better picture of some vacation destinations using our coordinates
